This is an attempt to make it easy to search for a particular kind of item or image in a large collection of icons.

# Feature list
## Required

- Add a folder to the library.
- Show all images in a folder.
- Tag images.
- Remember the tags. By saving them in a `.asset_dir.csv` in the directory itself?
- Show all images with a tag

# Whishlist

- Autosave interval? So we don't save for every little thing.
- Automatically discover alternate versions of an image (transparent / psd file etc.)
- Detect when we add a folder which is inside a folder we already have added.
    - Or vice-versa, if we add a folder which is a parent folder of another one.
